# I - General Provisions

## Article 1 Scope of application

### 1.01

These regulations apply whenever expressly referred to by specific regulations governing a UEFA competition.

### 1.02

They govern the minimum structural criteria to be fulfilled by a stadium in order for it to be classified (in ascending rank order) as UEFA category 1, 2, 3 or 4. The higher the category is, the stricter and more numerous the criteria (Articles 5-38). The structural criteria applicable to specific categories are presented in the form of tables showing the criteria gradation between the different categories. Structural criteria that are not presented in the form of tables apply to all categories.

### 1.03

These regulations further set out the responsibilities for monitoring compliance with the structural criteria for the required stadium category and specify the conditions under which the UEFA administration may grant an exception to a specific structural criterion (Article 3).

### 1.04

These regulations do not affect the legal obligations arising from national law applicable to stadium facilities.

## Article 2 Connection with competition regulations

### 2.01

The relevant UEFA competition regulations:

specify the minimum category of stadium required for matches in the competition concerned;

may define further and/or stricter structural criteria for the required category than those set out in these regulations.

## Article 3 Roles and responsibilities

### 3.01

Each association on whose territory matches in a UEFA competition are played is responsible for:

inspecting every stadium concerned and completing the corresponding online form confirming to the UEFA administration that each stadium meets the structural criteria of the required stadium category;

confirming to the UEFA administration that the stadiums, including their stands and facilities (emergency lighting system, first aid facilities, protection against intrusion by spectators into the playing area, etc.), have been thoroughly inspected by the competent public authorities and that the latter have confirmed in writing that the stadiums meet all the safety requirements laid down by the applicable national law.

### 3.02

The UEFA administration makes decisions on stadiums to be used on the basis of the above form and confirmation, and any other information gathered by UEFA. Such decisions are final.

### 3.03

The UEFA administration may inspect stadiums at any time before and during the UEFA competition in which they are used, to check whether the required structural criteria are met.

### 3.04

The UEFA administration may grant an exception to a specific structural criterion in cases of particular hardship and upon reasoned request, for instance owing to the current national legislation or if the fulfilment of all the required criteria would force a club or association to play its home matches on the territory of another association. Exceptions are always granted for a limited period of time. Such decisions are final.
